I created required header and source code files. They have the VRC and the matrix generatinig it inside. The program 
will run successfully and outputs two windows. To finish this assignment, I need to use hidden surface algorithm first 
calculating the points visible to viewers. Then use gouraud algorithm to calculate shading. Finally, ray-tracing will
be used to cast each object.
